🔢 Handwritten Digit Classification (using asi.py)
This project performs classification of handwritten digits using the popular digits dataset from scikit-learn`. It compares the performance of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.

🛠 Features
Uses Scikit-learn's load_digits dataset.

Implements two classification models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)

Evaluates models using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

📊 Results
Accuracy comparison between both models

Detailed evaluation metrics for performance analysis

📁 File: asi.py
A single-file script that loads data, trains both models, evaluates them, and prints out detailed results.
